# google-homepage
Build google homepage - CSS/HTMl project from The Odin Project Curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
  
As a beginner HTML/CSS project, the objective was simply to replicate the look/layout of Google's homepage, not it's functionality or interactivity.
